# Decisions behind land-pr

Derived on 2026-09-12 from ten PR-review conversation threads covering PRs
#1 through #12, plus the canonical-test/release thread. Original messages
were checked alongside local Git history, current project instructions and
the old Claude skill. These are historical decisions, not live PR status.
No raw private transcript is included.

| Review | Lesson retained |
| --- | --- |
| #1 Xiaomi; first #2 Nothing review | Resolve manifest conflicts using current descriptions and retain credit. The maintainer explicitly deferred Xiaomi's missing screenshot; that was a specific exception. Nothing's keyboard handling and repeating UUID probe needed review despite passing tests. |
| #3 Soundcore; second #2 review | Integrate into the current shared bridge architecture and preserve per-brand ambient ranges/labels. Nothing was implemented separately; useful evidence and an image from #2 were credited without importing obsolete code. Do not label a superseded PR merged without evidence. |
| #4 Sony XM5 | Startup ordering also exposed a separate Fast Pair reader race. A guessed delay for a daemon crash proved ineffective and was reverted. Diagnose before broadening a PR. A failed revert followed by a version/push sequence showed why release steps must stop on failure. |
| #5 Soundcore One Pro | The user rejected new queries to existing Space 2 merely because the risk seemed low. Model rows preserved both startup and delayed confirmation behavior; new/unknown models received wider discovery. Synthetic historical tests had explicit limits. |
| #6 Sony XM4 | Handshake assumptions, parser acceptance and unobserved variants endangered existing Sony support. Old/new replay comparison and a CH720N live test distinguished the behaviors. Later audit found a missing version bump and stale probe/docs. The user repeatedly shortened the public thank-you. |
| #7 Sony XM6 and #8 Galaxy Buds2 | A new wear query went to all Sony devices and existing tests were adjusted to fit. Repairs froze older rows, used the shell media service and called out a default affecting everyone. Samsung's unobserved alternate status layout was removed and silence/parking corrected. The user chose patch-only bumps and requested the original skill. |
| #9 Collexion/gallery | Claims were limited to visible controls; a screenshot did not establish hidden controls or wear behavior. The user requested the full, short public comment independently of merge approval. |
| #10 Collexion image update | A stale branch restored old image names and an earlier version. Only the new image and supported claims were retained against current main. No shell restart was needed for documentation, and unrelated development work stayed intact. |
| #11 OPPO | Review covered existing bridge isolation, backend priority and parser/lifecycle tests. No CI runs were attached at that time; this was disclosed. The user prompted a README/manifest audit and version bump. The approved comment was brief and warm. |
| Canonical tests / 1.3.0 | Owner tests are substantively immutable. Expanded real-capture, UUID, fault and live coverage applies to new models; existing models were grandfathered. Harness semantics still need review. Mode persistence across refresh does not establish fresh battery telemetry. Preserve settings and bar placement. |
| #12 CMF / 1.3.1 | Local checks passed while shared channel fallback changed legacy Nothing retries. Per-model repairs and full captured-frame tests preserved original pins. CI-only socket constants were fixed in test doubles. The author tested repaired head 22497ef before landing, confirming controls/reconnect/restoration but not peer isolation, charging or acoustic effects. A cropped owner image was retained with an honest description. |

Conversation IDs locate original Claude project records or Codex archived
rollouts without embedding local paths or unrelated conversation content.
The #12 archive includes the later September 11 completion, superseding an
older summary that still called it pending.

## Deliberate updates to the old skill

- Repair permission follows session instructions. The old repair-before-report
  sequence cannot override a request to approve scope first.
- Remember approval already given; do not ask again for the same action.
- Validate repaired hardware behavior on the repaired revision before landing.
  Earlier speculative merges were specific decisions under older requirements.
- Prepare merge/version changes outside the live plugin; deployment is separate.
- Inspect actual CI; never assume a workflow passed or that absence means success.
- Explicit patch bumps and remote checks prevent forgotten/incomplete releases.
- Keep public thanks brief; protocol detail belongs in the internal review.
- Do not inherit fabricated agent/session trailers, automatic monitoring,
  marketplace posts, GitHub Releases or mandatory subagents from old sessions.
